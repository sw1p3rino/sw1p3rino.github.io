Hey, my name is Martin Fuchs and i am a Penetration Tester from Austria. 

I love learning about cybersecurity and trying new things. That's why I started this blog, so I can share my ideas and learning experiences with others who might find them useful.

If you have questions about my posts or just want to crack a box together, hit me up at
