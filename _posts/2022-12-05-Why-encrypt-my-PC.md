In my post [How to not get hacked (for users)](https://swiper.at/posts/How-To-Not-Get-Hacked-for-users/#4-encrypt-your-pcs-hard-drive) i made the point that encrypting your hard drive is one of the base steps to increase your cyber security and that it only takes about 3 minutes and barely any skill to get into your machine.

Let me demonstrate how anyone could bypass the login and access your data in this about 3 minute long video:

Just so you know. All this fancy usb startup thing is not needed. The attacker could just remove the hard drive from your computer and plug it into his own. This is just a fancy, fast and sneaky way to do it. Additionally, this is not a windows thing, it works regardless of the operating system you use.

How to mitigate this?
1. Encrypt **all** your hard drives
2. Password protect your BIOS
3. Dont let anyone get their hands on your PC
